# dotfiles

Configuration files for common shells, applications and services such as bash, zsh and tmux.

## ZSH Configuration (zsh4humans)

These are the core files for setting up [zsh4humans](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans/tree/master).

Ensure `zsh` is installed, of course.

Copy the following files to the home directory.

- `.zshenv`
- `.zshrc`
- `.p10k.zsh`

Install the [MesloLGS Nerd Font patched for Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/font.md).

The MesloLGS font files were added to this repository in `./fonts`.

And setup the SSH configuration if SSH copying of zsh files is wanted.
